# Principal Investigator (PI/Co-PI)

I lead two Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) projects at PNNL and co-lead one DOE one project sponsored by the DOE Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO)

* **PNNL-LDRD -- Resilience Metrics for Cyber-physical (Power) Systems** [\$ 140k]

Outage-based, topological, and operation envelope-based metrics are developed to quantify the resilience of cyber-physical power system. Outage results are developed based on [EAGLE-I Outage Data](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/The_Environment_for_Analysis_of_Geo-Located_Energy_Information_s_Recorded_Electricity_Outages_2014-2022/24237376) and [EIA Annual Disturbance Events Data](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/disturbance/disturb_events_archive.html).
A visualization tool was developed for visualizing the American results. Dynamic operation envelop is developed for quantifying resilience results under extreme heat wave and cold wave, considering the flexibiltiy from virtual power plants.

* **PNNL-LDRD -- Stability Characterization for Co-design of Power Electronics-dominant Power Systems** [\$ 200k]

This is an ongoing project. We will characterize the stability of power electronics-dominant power systems and develop stability criteria to guide their co-design. The project will quantify the relationships among co-design decision variables, controller parameters, and stability conditions.

* **DOE-WETO -- Stability-Informed Co-Design for Grid-Forming Inverters Deployment in IBR-Dominant Power Systems** [\$ 1.4 Million]

Ongoing project. Technical details to be released.

# Task lead

I worked as task lead on the follwoing DOE, DOD, and PNNL sponsered projects.

* **DOD-ESTCP -- Model-Free Adaptive Control for Autonomous and Resilient Operation of Microgrids**

I conducted a few groups of work under this project, including: 1) Inverter PQ control with trajectory tracking capability based on physical-informed reinforcement learning; 2) Decentralized and coordinated V-f control for islanded microgrids considering DER adequacy and demand control; 3) Virtual inertia scheduling for real-time economic dispatch of IBR-penetrated power system; 4) Virtual inertia scheduling for microgrids with static and dynamic security constraints

* **DOE -- Large Scale Testbed for Cyber-physical Power Grid Simulation**

I contributed to the development [large scale testbed (LTB)](https://ltb.curent.org/) for cyber-physical power grid simulation. Specifically, a power market simulator [AMS](https://docs.andes.app/en/latest/?badge=latest). Check teams on the [website](https://ltb.curent.org/team/).

* **DOE -- Advanced Grid Modeling of Future Power Systems**

I developed an analytical EMT model of inverter-based microgrids and proposed a controller design approach with guaranteed large signal stability. The approach is validated through power hardware-in-the-loop experiments in [CURENT HTB](https://curent.utk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tolbert_Fact_Sheet_Web.pdf)

* **PNNL-LDRD -- Control Oriented Models for Co-design Optimization**

I developed an EMT model of a 240-bus miniWECC system in PSCAD, integrating offshore wind farms, IBRs, and HVDC/MTDC. This model was transformed from PSS/e using ETran. Additionally, I developed analytical and numerical wind turbine models in Python using Sympy.

* **PNNL-LDRD -- Multi-Objective Co-design Optimization for Pareto-Set Identification**

I developed dynamic constraints for power system co-design (planning) problems. This work is tailored for offshore wind farms connected to the main grid through HVDC/MTDC, and equipped with frequency support capabilities.

* **PNNL-LDRD -- Predictive Risk Informed Data-driven Resilient Controls**

I developed a dispatch-dynamic co-simulation platform for power systems. This platform emulates denial-of-service and false data injection attacks, integrating them into the workflow for batch data generation and computational attack detection.
