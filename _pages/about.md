# About me

Buxin She is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Kansas State University (KSU). Before joining KSU, he was a Senior Research Engineer in the [optimization and control group](https://www.pnnl.gov/electricity-infrastructure-buildings-division-groups) of [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)](https://www.pnnl.gov/), where he led two PNNL Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) projects, one focusing on resilience analysis of cyber-physical (power) system under [RD2C Initiative](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/rd2c-initiative) and one on stability characterization of power electronics-dominant power system under the [E-COMP Initiative](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/e-comp). He also co-leads one project sponsored by the DOE Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO).

He serves as the chair of the IEEE Task Force on [*Virtual Inertia Scheduling and Control for IBR-dominant Power Systems*](https://cmte.ieee.org/pes-visc/). He is also the Sub-Team Lead of the Modeling Requirements and Data Collection Subteam within the ESIG Large Loads Task Force.

He serves as an Associate Editor of *IEEE Data Description* and *Chinese Journal of Electrical Engineering (CJEE)*. He was a Guest Editor of *International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems (IJEPES)* and *IET Renewable Power Generation*. 
He is also a member of the Young Advisory Board of *IET Energy Conversion and Economics*. 
He was recognized as an Outstanding Reviewer by the multiple top journals.

He leads the **I**ntelligent **P**ower (IP) Lab with the mission of advancing power systems through inverter-based resources (IBRs) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enable secure, resilient, and economical power supply. 
His research focuses on:

* Modeling, control, and stability analysis of inverter-based resources (IBRs)
* Dynamics-informed planning and operation of power system
* AI-driven power system simulation, control and optimization
