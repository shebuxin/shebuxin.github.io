Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [the University of Tennessee Knoxville](https://www.eecs.utk.edu), advised by [Dr. Fangxing Li](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~fli6/). My research interests lie broadly in control, optimization and machine learning for power systems, which specifically include microgrid IBR control, security-constrained economic dispatch, and distribution system operation and plan. The employed theories include but are not limited to control theory, convex optimization (including SDP and LMI), deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning.
